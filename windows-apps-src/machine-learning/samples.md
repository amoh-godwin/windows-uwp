# Windows ML (Preview) samples

> [!NOTE]
> Windows ML is a preview feature which may be substantially modified before itâ€™s officially released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.

The following sample UWP apps demonstrate how to use Windows ML and are available to download from the [Windows-Machine-Learning](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-Machine-Learning) repo on GitHub.

## MNIST Multilayer Perceptron

[This sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Samples/UWP/MNIST) uses the CNTK MNIST model to interpret a numeric digit drawn by the user. You can walk through the sample with a step-by-step tutorial in [Get Started](get-started.md).

## SqueezeNet Image Classifier

[This sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Samples/UWP/SqueezeNetObjectDetection) detects the predominant object in an image.

## Windows Machine Learning Explorer

[This sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Samples/UWP/WinMLExplorer) is a data driven and generic application that bootstraps ML models that can detect defects in circuit boards from pictures or a real-time camera feed.
