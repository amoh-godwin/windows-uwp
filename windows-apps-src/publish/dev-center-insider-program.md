# Dev Center Insider Program

As a [registered developer](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=615100), you can help influence the functionality we make available in the Dev Center dashboard by joining the Dev Center Insider Program. This program allows you to try out new features before they become available to all developers. We encourage you to give us your feedback on these features by using the Feedback link under the question mark icon in the upper right corner of Dev Center. All of the feedback we receive from Dev Center Insiders will be read closely and given priority consideration.

To join the program, opt in on the **Account settings** page in your Dev Center dashboard. You can opt out at any time.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The terms of the [App Developer Agreement](https://docs.microsoft.com/legal/windows/agreements/app-developer-agreement) apply to your participation in the program. Please read them, particularly Exhibit I, before you join the program. Keep in mind that the features made available exclusively to people in the Dev Center Insider Program may include experimental and early prerelease services. This means that these features often don’t have documentation available yet, and you may experience unintended results when using them.

Here are some of the features that we’ve made available exclusively to members of the Dev Center Insider Program. This list will change over time as new features are added (and as features introduced to the Insider Program are made available to everyone).

| Dev Center Insider Program feature   | How Dev Center Insiders can try it | Date added |

|**Churn prediction chart on Usage report**: See how many users we predict are likely to stop using your app soon, based on their recent usage. | In the **Usage** report, view the **Churn prediction** chart to see a prediction of how many users will stop using the app (or use it for less than 10 minutes) in the next 15 days. After each cycle, the chart shows how many users stopped using the app, along with the number we predicted. This info is updated twice per month.  | January 2018 |
|**View more details from your overview page**: Get more details on highlighted apps without leaving your overview page. | On the overview page, look for the boxes highlighting key statistics for your apps. Click any of the boxes to see more details about that app. | September 2017 |
|**Cohort active usage analytics**: Track week-by-week usage for cohorts (groups of active users who started using your app in the same week) for insights into usage trends.  | In the **Usage** report, view the **Cohorts by active usage** chart.  |July 2017|
|**Churn prediction option for customer segments**: Create a segment of your customers based on whether we detect that they’re likely to stop using your app soon.  | In the **Engage** section, select **Customer groups** to create a new segment. In the inclusion conditions section, select **Churn prediction** in the first drop-down, then choose **true** or **false** to define your segment. |May 2017|
|**Email notification for analytic trend changes**: Get notified about significant changes in your apps' acquisitions. | If we detect a significant change in an app's acquisition numbers compared to its historical data, we'll automatically send you an email. |April 2017|

The new report uses real-time event collection from your Windows 10 customers. | Choose **Real time report** in the left menu under **Analytics**.
