This topic shows the ways in which you can both create and consume Windows Runtime asynchronous objects with C++/WinRT.

## Asynchronous operations and Windows Runtime "Async" functions
Any Windows Runtime API that has the potential to take more than 50 milliseconds to complete is implemented as an asynchronous function (with a name ending in "Async"). The implementation of an asynchronous function initiates the work on another thread and returns immediately with an object that represents the asynchronous operation. When the asynchronous operation completes, that returned object contains any value that resulted from the work. The **Windows::Foundation** Windows Runtime namespace contains four types of asynchronous operation object.

- [**IAsyncAction**](/uwp/api/windows.foundation.iasyncaction),
- [**IAsyncActionWithProgress&lt;TProgress&gt;**](/uwp/api/windows.foundation.iasyncactionwithprogress_tprogress_),
- [**IAsyncOperation&lt;TResult&gt;**](/uwp/api/windows.foundation.iasyncoperation_tresult_), and
- [**IAsyncOperationWithProgress&lt;TResult, TProgress&gt;**](/uwp/api/windows.foundation.iasyncoperationwithprogress_tresult_tprogress_).

Each of these asynchronous operation types is projected into a corresponding type in the **winrt::Windows::Foundation** C++/WinRT namespace. C++/WinRT also contains an internal await adapter struct. You don't use it directly but, thanks to that struct, you can write a ``co_await` statement to cooperatively await the result of any function that returns one of these asychronous operation types. And you can author your own coroutines that return these types.

An example of an asynchronous Windows function is [**SyndicationClient::RetrieveFeedAsync**](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.web.syndication.syndicationclient.retrievefeedasync), which returns an asynchronous operation object of type [**IAsyncOperationWithProgress&lt;TResult, TProgress&gt;**](/uwp/api/windows.foundation.iasyncoperationwithprogress_tresult_tprogress_). Let's look at some ways&mdash;blocking and non-blocking&mdash;of using C++/WinRT to call an API such as that.

## Block the calling thread
The code example below receives an asynchronous operation object from **RetrieveFeedAsync**, and it calls **get** on that object to block the calling thread until the results of the asynchronous operation are available.

```cppwinrt
// main.cpp

#include "pch.h"
#include <winrt/Windows.Foundation.h>
#include <winrt/Windows.Web.Syndication.h>

using namespace winrt;
using namespace Windows::Foundation;
using namespace Windows::Web::Syndication;

void ProcessFeed()
{
    Uri rssFeedUri{ L"https://blogs.windows.com/feed" };
    SyndicationClient syndicationClient;
    SyndicationFeed syndicationFeed = syndicationClient.RetrieveFeedAsync(rssFeedUri).get();
    // use syndicationFeed.
}

int main()
{
    winrt::init_apartment();
    ProcessFeed();
}
```

Calling **get** makes for convenient coding, and it's ideal for console apps or background threads where you may not want to use a coroutine for whatever reason. But it's not concurrent nor asynchronous, so it's not appropriate for a UI thread (and an assertion will fire in unoptimized builds if you attempt to use it on one). To avoid holding up OS threads from doing other useful work, we need a different technique.

## Write a coroutine
C++/WinRT integrates C++ coroutines into the programming model to provide a natural way to cooperatively wait for a result. You can produce your own Windows Runtime asynchronous operation by writing a coroutine. In the code example below, **ProcessFeedAsync** is the coroutine.

```cppwinrt
// main.cpp

#include "pch.h"
#include <winrt/Windows.Foundation.h>
#include <winrt/Windows.Web.Syndication.h>
#include <iostream>

using namespace winrt;
using namespace Windows::Foundation;
using namespace Windows::Web::Syndication;

void PrintFeed(SyndicationFeed const& syndicationFeed)
{
    for (SyndicationItem const& syndicationItem : syndicationFeed.Items())
    {
        std::wcout << syndicationItem.Title().Text().c_str() << std::endl;
    }
}

IAsyncAction ProcessFeedAsync()
{
    Uri rssFeedUri{ L"https://blogs.windows.com/feed" };
    SyndicationClient syndicationClient;
    SyndicationFeed syndicationFeed{ co_await syndicationClient.RetrieveFeedAsync(rssFeedUri) };
    PrintFeed(syndicationFeed);
}

int main()
{
    winrt::init_apartment();

    auto processOp = ProcessFeedAsync();
    // do other work while the feed is being printed.
    processOp.get(); // no more work to do; call get() so that we see the printout before the application exits.
}
```

A coroutine is a function that can be suspended and resumed. In the **ProcessFeedAsync** coroutine above, when the `co_await` statement is reached, the coroutine asynchronously initiates the **RetrieveFeedAsync** call and then it immediately suspends itself and returns control back to the caller (which is **main** in the example above). **main** can then continue to do work while the feed is being retrieved and printed. When that's done (when the **RetrieveFeedAsync** call completes), the **ProcessFeedAsync** coroutine resumes at the next statement.

You can aggregate a coroutine into other coroutines. Or you can call **get** to block and wait for it to complete (and get the result if there is one). Or you can pass it to another programming language that supports the Windows Runtime.

It's also possible to handle the completed and/or progress events of asynchronous actions and operations by using delegates. For details, and code examples, see [Delegate types for asynchronous actions and operations](handle-events.md#delegate-types-for-asynchronous-actions-and-operations).

## Asychronously return a Windows Runtime type
In this next example we wrap a call to **RetrieveFeedAsync**, for a specific URI, to give us a **RetrieveBlogFeedAsync** function that asynchronously returns a [**SyndicationFeed**](/uwp/api/windows.web.syndication.syndicationfeed).

```cppwinrt
// main.cpp

#include "pch.h"
#include <winrt/Windows.Foundation.h>
#include <winrt/Windows.Web.Syndication.h>
#include <iostream>

using namespace winrt;
using namespace Windows::Foundation;
using namespace Windows::Web::Syndication;

void PrintFeed(SyndicationFeed const& syndicationFeed)
{
    for (SyndicationItem const& syndicationItem : syndicationFeed.Items())
    {
        std::wcout << syndicationItem.Title().Text().c_str() << std::endl;
    }
}

IAsyncOperationWithProgress<SyndicationFeed, RetrievalProgress> RetrieveBlogFeedAsync()
{
    Uri rssFeedUri{ L"https://blogs.windows.com/feed" };
    SyndicationClient syndicationClient;
    return syndicationClient.RetrieveFeedAsync(rssFeedUri);
}

int main()
{
    winrt::init_apartment();

    auto feedOp = RetrieveBlogFeedAsync();
    // do other work.
    PrintFeed(feedOp.get());
}
```

In the example above, **RetrieveBlogFeedAsync** returns an **IAsyncOperationWithProgress**, which has both progress and a return value. We can do other work while **RetrieveBlogFeedAsync** is doing its thing and retrieving the feed. Then, we call **get** on that asynchronous operation object to block, wait for it to complete, and then obtain the results of the operation.

If you're asynchronously returning a Windows Runtime type, then you should return an [**IAsyncOperation&lt;TResult&gt;**](/uwp/api/windows.foundation.iasyncoperation_tresult_) or an [**IAsyncOperationWithProgress&lt;TResult, TProgress&gt;**](/uwp/api/windows.foundation.iasyncoperationwithprogress_tresult_tprogress_). Any first- or third-party runtime class qualifies, or any type that can be passed to or from a Windows Runtime function (for example, `int`, or **winrt::hstring**). The compiler will help you with a "*must be WinRT type*" error if you try to use one of these asychronous operation types with a non-Windows Runtime type.

If a coroutine doesn't have at least one `co_await` statement then, in order to qualify as a coroutine, it must have at least one `co_return` or one `co_yield` statement. There will be cases where your coroutine can return a value without introducing any asynchrony, and therefore without blocking nor switching context. Here's an example that does that (the second and subsequent times it's called) by caching a value.

```cppwinrt
winrt::hstring m_cache;
 
IAsyncOperation<winrt::hstring> ReadAsync()
{
    if (m_cache.empty())
    {
        // Asynchronously download and cache the string.
    }
    co_return m_cache;
}
``` 

## Asychronously return a non-Windows-Runtime type
If you're asynchronously returning a type that's *not* a Windows Runtime type, then you should return a Parallel Patterns Library (PPL) [**concurrency::task**](/cpp/parallel/concrt/reference/task-class). We recommend **concurrency::task** because it gives you better performance (and better compatibility going forward) than **std::future** does.

> [!TIP]
> If you include `<pplawait.h>`, then you can use **concurrency::task** as a coroutine type.

```cppwinrt
// main.cpp

#include "pch.h"
#include <winrt/Windows.Foundation.h>
#include <winrt/Windows.Web.Syndication.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <ppltasks.h>

using namespace winrt;
using namespace Windows::Foundation;
using namespace Windows::Web::Syndication;

concurrency::task<std::wstring> RetrieveFirstTitleAsync()
{
    return concurrency::create_task([]
    {
        Uri rssFeedUri{ L"https://blogs.windows.com/feed" };
        SyndicationClient syndicationClient;
        SyndicationFeed syndicationFeed = syndicationClient.RetrieveFeedAsync(rssFeedUri).get();
        return std::wstring{ syndicationFeed.Items().GetAt(0).Title().Text() };
    });
}

int main()
{
    winrt::init_apartment();

    auto firstTitleOp = RetrieveFirstTitleAsync();
    // Do other work here.
    std::wcout << firstTitleOp.get() << std::endl;
}
```

## Parameter-passing
For synchronous functions, you should use `const&` parameters by default. That will avoid the overhead of copies (which involve reference counting, and that means interlocked increments and decrements).

```cppwinrt
// Synchronous function.
void DoWork(Param const& value);
```

But you can run into problems if you pass a reference parameter to a coroutine.

```cppwinrt
// NOT the recommended way to pass a value to a coroutine!
IASyncAction DoWorkAsync(Param const& value)
{
	// While it's ok to access value here...
	
	co_await DoOtherWorkAsync();

	// ...accessing value here carries no guarantees of safety.
}
```

In a coroutine, execution is synchronous up until the first suspension point, where control is returned to the caller. By the time the coroutine resumes, anything might have happened to the source value that a reference parameter references. From the coroutine's perspective, a reference parameter has uncontrolled lifetime. So, in the example above, we're safe to access *value* up until the `co_await`, but not after it. Nor can we safely pass *value* to **DoOtherWorkAsync** if there's any risk that that function will in turn suspend and then try to use *value* after it resumes. To make parameters safe to use after suspending and resuming, your coroutines should use pass-by-value by default to ensure that they capture by value and avoid lifetime issues. Cases when you can deviate from that guidance because you're certain that it's safe to do so are going to be rare.

```cppwinrt
// Coroutine
IASyncAction DoWorkAsync(Param value);
```

It's also arguable that (unless you want to move the value) passing by const value is good practice. It won't have any effect on the source value from which you're making a copy, but it makes the intent clear, and helps if you inadvertently modify the copy.
	
```cppwinrt
// coroutine with strictly unnecessary const (but arguably good practice).
IASyncAction DoWorkAsync(Param const value);
```

Also see [Standard arrays and vectors](std-cpp-data-types.md#standard-arrays-and-vectors), which deals with how to pass a standard vector into an asynchronous callee.

## Offloading work onto the Windows thread pool
Before you do compute-bound work in a coroutine, you need to return execution to the caller so that the caller isn't blocked (in other words, introduce a suspension point). If you're not already doing that by `co-await`-ing some other operation, then you can `co-await` the **winrt::resume_background** function. That returns control to the caller, and then immediately resumes execution on a thread pool thread.

The thread pool being used in the implementation is the low-level [Windows thread pool](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms686766), so it's optimially efficient.

```cppwinrt
IAsyncOperation<uint32_t> DoWorkOnThreadPoolAsync()
{
    co_await winrt::resume_background(); // Return control; resume on thread pool.

    uint32_t result;
    for (uint32_t y = 0; y < height; ++y)
    for (uint32_t x = 0; x < width; ++x)
    {
        // Do compute-bound work here.
    }
    co_return result;
}
```

## Programming with thread affinity in mind
This scenario expands on the previous one. You offload some work onto the thread pool, but then you want to display progress in the user interface (UI).

```cppwinrt
IAsyncAction DoWorkAsync(TextBlock textblock)
{
    co_await winrt::resume_background();
    // Do compute-bound work here.

    textblock.Text(L"Done!"); // Error: TextBlock has thread affinity.
}
```

The code above throws a [**winrt::hresult_wrong_thread**](/uwp/cpp-ref-for-winrt/hresult-wrong-thread) exception, because a **TextBlock** must be updated from the thread that created it, which is the UI thread. One solution is to capture the thread context within which our coroutine was originally called. Instantiate a **winrt::apartment_context** object, and then `co_await` it.

```cppwinrt
IAsyncAction DoWorkAsync(TextBlock textblock)
{
    winrt::apartment_context ui_thread; // Capture calling context.

    co_await winrt::resume_background();
    // Do compute-bound work here.

    co_await ui_thread; // Switch back to calling context.

    textblock.Text(L"Done!"); // Ok if we really were called from the UI thread.
}
```

As long as the coroutine above is called from the UI thread that created the **TextBlock**, then this technique works. There will be many cases in your app where you're certain of that.

For a more general solution to updating UI, which covers cases where you're uncertain about the calling thread, you can install the [Windows 10 SDK Preview Build 17661](https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewSDK), or later. Then, you can `co-await` the **winrt::resume_foreground** function to switch to a specific foreground thread. In the code example below, we specify the foreground thread by passing the dispatcher object associated with the **TextBlock** (by accessing its [**Dispatcher**](/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.dependencyobject.dispatcher#Windows_UI_Xaml_DependencyObject_Dispatcher) property). The implementation of **winrt::resume_foreground** calls [**CoreDispatcher.RunAsync**](/uwp/api/windows.ui.core.coredispatcher.runasync) on that dispatcher object to execute the work that comes after it in the coroutine.

```cppwinrt
IAsyncAction DoWorkAsync(TextBlock textblock)
{
    co_await winrt::resume_background();
    // Do compute-bound work here.

    co_await winrt::resume_foreground(textblock.Dispatcher()); // Switch to the foreground thread associated with textblock.

    textblock.Text(L"Done!"); // Guaranteed to work.
}
```
