# Run, debug, and test a packaged desktop app (Desktop Bridge)

Run your packaged app and see how it looks without having to sign it. Then, set breakpoints and step through code. When you're ready to test your app in a production environment, sign your app and then install it. This topic shows you how to do each of these things.

<a id="run-app" />

## Run your app

You can run your app to test it out locally without having to obtain a certificate and sign it. How you run the app depends on what tool you used to create the package.

### You created the package by using Visual Studio

Set the packaging project as the startup project, and then press CTRL+F5 to start your app.

### You created the package manually or by using the Desktop App Converter

Open a Windows PowerShell command prompt, and from the **PackageFiles** subfolder of your output folder, run this cmdlet:

```
Add-AppxPackage â€“Register AppxManifest.xml
```
To start your app, find it in the Windows Start menu.

> [!NOTE]
> A packaged app always runs as an interactive user, and any drive that you install your packaged app on to must be formatted to NTFS format.

## Debug your app

How you debug the app depends on what tool you used to create the package.

If you created your package by using the [new packaging project](desktop-to-uwp-packaging-dot-net.md#new-packaging-project) available in the 15.4 release of Visual Studio 2017, Just set the packaging project as the startup project, and then press F5 to debug your app.

If you created your package by using any other tool, follow these steps.

1. Make sure that you start your packaged app at least one time so that it's installed on your local machine.

   See the [Run your app](#run-app) section above.

2. Start Visual Studio.

   If you want to debug your app with elevated permissions, start Visual Studio by using the **Run as Administrator** option.

3. In Visual Studio, choose **Debug**->**Other Debug Targets**->**Debug Installed App Package**.

4. In the **Installed App Packages** list, select your app package, and then choose the **Attach** button.

#### Modify your app in between debug sessions

If you make your changes to your app to fix bugs, repackage it by using the MakeAppx tool. See [Run the MakeAppx tool](desktop-to-uwp-manual-conversion.md#make-appx).

### Debug the entire app lifecycle

In some cases, you might want finer-grained control over the debugging process, including the ability to debug your app before it starts.

You can use [PLMDebug](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/jj680085(v=vs.85).aspx) to get full control over app lifecycle including suspending, resuming, and termination.

[PLMDebug](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/jj680085(v=vs.85).aspx) is included with the Windows SDK.

## Test your app

To test your app in a realistic setting as you prepare for distribution, it's best to sign your app and then install it.

### Test an app that you packaged by using Visual Studio

Visual Studio signs your app by using a test certificate. You'll find that certificate in the output folder that the **Create App Packages** wizard generates. The certificate file has the *.cer* extension and you'll have to install that certificate into the **Trusted Root Certification Authorities** store on the PC that you want to test your app on. See [Sideload your package](../packaging/packaging-uwp-apps.md#sideload-your-app-package).

### Test an app that you packaged by using the Desktop App Converter (DAC)

If you package your app by using the Desktop App Converter, you can use the ``sign`` parameter to automatically sign your app by using a generated certificate. You'll have to install that certificate, and then install the app. See [Run the packaged app](desktop-to-uwp-run-desktop-app-converter.md#run-app).   


### Manually sign apps (Optional)

You can also sign your app manually. Here's how

1. Create a certificate. See [Create a certificate](../packaging/create-certificate-package-signing.md).

2. Install that certificate into the **Trusted Root** or **Trusted People** certificate store on your system.

3. Sign your app by using that certificate, see [Sign an app package using SignTool](../packaging/sign-app-package-using-signtool.md).

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Make sure that the publisher name on your certificate matches the publisher name of your app.

### Test your app for Windows 10 S

Before you publish your app, make sure that it will operate correctly on devices that run Windows 10 S. In fact, if you plan to publish your app to the Microsoft Store, you must do this because it is a store requirement. Apps that don't operate correctly on devices that run Windows 10 S won't be certified.

See [Test your Windows app for Windows 10 S](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/porting/desktop-to-uwp-test-windows-s).

### Run another process inside the full trust container

You can invoke custom processes inside the container of a specified app package. This can be useful for testing scenarios (for example, if you have a custom test harness and want to test output of the app). To do so, use the ```Invoke-CommandInDesktopPackage``` PowerShell cmdlet:

```CMD
Invoke-CommandInDesktopPackage [-PackageFamilyName] <string> [-AppId] <string> [-Command] <string> [[-Args]
    <string>]  [<CommonParameters>]
```
